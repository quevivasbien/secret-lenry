## How to set up dev environment

You should just need a recent version of NodeJS with NPM (or an equivalent):

* On MacOS, with homebrew, `brew install node@22`
* On Debian/Ubuntu, with apt, `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`

Then just run `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm run dev` to start a dev server.

This project is built with SvelteKit with Svelte 5. [See documentation here](https://svelte.dev/docs). We use [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).
